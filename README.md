# Library Test

This is a test using `bun` and `tsup` to create a library.

## Install

```bash
bun install
```

## Run

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

## Bundling

Currently using `tsup` for bundling. See `package.json` for details.

I will likely switch to `bun` once it is more mature.

```bash
bun run build
```

## Linting

I'm using `tsc` for linting. See `tsconfig.json` for details.

```bash
bun run lint
```
